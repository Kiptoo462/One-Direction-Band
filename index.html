    <div id="introduction">
      <p>One Direction, also known as 1D, is an English-Irish pop boy band that formed in London, England in 2010. Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson make up the band; former member Zayn Malik left the group in March 2015. After forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010, the group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records.</p>
      <p>Social media has catapulted them to global success. One Direction's five albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts in most major markets and spawned hit singles such as "What Makes You Beautiful" (their first number one on the UK Singles Chart and the highest debut for a British act on the US Billboard Hot 100 since 1998), "Live While We're Young", "Best Song Ever", and "Best Song Ever". One Direction became the first band in US Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one after the release of Four.</p>
